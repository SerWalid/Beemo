        Once upon a time, there was a boy named Peter Parker. Peter wasn’t just
        any boy—he was special! One day, a tiny spider bit Peter, and guess what
        happened? Peter turned into Spider-Man! Now, he can climb walls and
        swing high in the sky with his sticky spider webs.
        <br /><br />
        Spider-Man loves to help people in the city. When someone is in trouble,
        Spider-Man swoops in to save the day! He uses his web to catch the bad
        guys and keep everyone safe. People in the city feel happy because they
        know Spider-Man is there to protect them.
        <br /><br />
        One day, a big, mean villain named Green Goblin tried to scare everyone.
        But Spider-Man wasn’t afraid. He used his webs to stop Green Goblin and
        made the city safe again.
        <br /><br />
        Even though Peter is just a regular kid, when he puts on his Spider-Man
        suit, he becomes a true hero. Spider-Man always remembers to be kind and
        help others. And that’s what makes him a great hero. The end!
