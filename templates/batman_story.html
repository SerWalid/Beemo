        In a city called Gotham, there was a brave hero named Batman. Batman wore a big cape and a mask, and he loved to help people when they were in trouble.
        <br><br>
        Batman had many cool gadgets, like a fast Bat-car and strong Bat-ropes. He used them to catch the bad guys and keep the city safe. But the best thing about Batman was his kind heart. He always wanted everyone in Gotham to be happy.
        <br><br>
        One day, a sneaky bad guy named Joker tried to cause trouble. But Batman wasnâ€™t scared. He used his Bat-ropes and his smart thinking to stop Joker.
        <br><br>
        Batman had friends too. Robin was his best friend, and Alfred helped him take care of everything. Together, they made sure Gotham was safe and sound. At night, when the stars came out, Batman stood on the tallest building and watched over the city to make sure everyone was safe and asleep. Batman was not just strong and smart, but also very kind. And that made him a true hero. The end!
