# Beemo

## Description
The Champs Team presents **Beemo**, an innovative solution designed to enhance the lives of autistic children and their families through advanced technology and empathetic design. Autistic children, who have unique ways of feeling, thinking, and expressing love, often face significant challenges in communication and social interaction.

In Tunisia and across Africa, the prevalence of autism spectrum disorder is becoming increasingly recognized, with recent studies indicating a rising number of diagnoses. However, there is still a significant gap in resources and support for autistic children, leading to high levels of stress and anxiety due to difficulties in navigating social situations. These challenges can negatively impact their academic performance and overall development.

**Beemo** combines computer vision, speech recognition, and generative AI to analyze facial expressions, understand spoken words, and generate empathetic responses, creating a meaningful and supportive interaction. **Beemo** is a gentle and interactive companion that engages children through voice interactions, educational content, and storytelling.

The integrated **Beemo** website provides parents with detailed insights, charts tracking repeated words, and analyses of emotional responses. The website also features a versatile chatbot for personalized interactions and serves as an informative hub about **Beemo** and its features, offering a comprehensive solution to support the unique needs of autistic children in Tunisia and across Africa.
